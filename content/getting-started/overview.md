# Getting Started with DocsHub

Welcome to DocsHub! This guide will help you set up your first documentation site in minutes.

## What is DocsHub?

DocsHub is a lightweight, static documentation generator built with:

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** — No backend required
- **Markdown** — Write content in plain text
- **YAML** — Configure everything declaratively

- **Full-Text Search** — Client-side search indexing

## Key Features

- 🎨 **Multiple Themes** — Switch between light, dark, blue, and high-contrast modes
- 🔍 **Instant Search** — Find pages instantly as you type
- 📱 **Mobile Responsive** — Works great on all devices
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Navigation** — Fully accessible
- 🚀 **Zero Backend** — Just static files, deploy anywhere

## Quick Start
