  # About Us
  
  We are building a *completely static*, filesystem-driven website that makes documentation easy and accessible.
  
  ## Our Mission
  
  To provide a simple, fast, and beautiful way to create and maintain documentation using only Markdown files.
  
  ## Why Static?
  
  - **Fast** - No server-side processing, instant page loads
  - **Simple** - Just markdown files, no database needed
  - **Reliable** - Works everywhere, no dependencies
  - **Version Control** - Track changes with Git
  - **Portable** - Easy to deploy anywhere
  
  ## Technology Stack
  
  This site is built with:
  - Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
  - Markdown for content
  - No build process required
  - Works with GitHub Pages out of the box
